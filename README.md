# UPS-PIco-HV4.0-GUI
A simple GUI for the UPS PIco HV4.0 from the manufacturer PiModules using Python.

This small code simplifies the entry of some values for the Pico. It is intended to replace the time-consuming work with the I2C commands.
I have only used the - in my opinion - important parameters. It is recommended to read the manual for the Pico to be able to set all parameters.
It runs with FW 0179 on the Pico. Other versions may work, but I cannot say for sure.
I will revise the GUI at irregular intervals.  
Call up web browser, enter local or IP address, the port is 5020

I actually only wrote the code for home use. That's why I didn't attach any importance to the language. I apologize that there is a bit of a language confusion at the moment :-)
